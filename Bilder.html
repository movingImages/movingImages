                <p class="card-text">In the painting you can see Charles XI, he ruled Sweden as king from 1660 to 1697, he was taught by his ministers because when Charles was 4 years old his father died.
                  At the age of 17 he won a war against the Danes in the "Scanian War" and after that he took care of improving the political/financial/economic situation of the country. He introduced many reforms concerning finance, national sea and land weapons, justice, church administration and education. He also managed to bring peace during his tenure by gaining independence in foreign affairs, economic stability and reorganizing & bringing the military up to current standards. This was all possible because Charles ruled under absolutism.
                  "Scanian War": Sweden had financial problems and allied with France, which helped with grants to the economy. When France then provoked a war with the Danes, Sweden was forced to assist in the war. Decisive battles were: "Battle of Halmstadt" & "Battle of Lund" & "Battle of Landskrona".
                  David Klöcker Ehrenstahl was a Swedish painter who was more of an entrepreneur. He did not even paint many paintings himself, but had his employees work on the paintings.

                <p class="card-text">In the painting you can see an old man sitting at a table and writing a text. 
                  This man is Saint Paul, who is writing his last will. You can also see the strong reflection of the light on the polished wooden table. His gaze wanders to what he has recently written. It is also remarkable that one sees a book that has been turned over halfway. This probably indicates that he is writing down or rewriting a few verses from the Bible. He wears a red coat, which in earlier times symbolized the blood of Christ.
                  The painting is in "Museum of fine Art", Texas and was painted by Valentin de Boulogne. He was a famous French painter, who also painted "The Martyrdom of St. Processus and Martinian" in St. Peter's Basilica. His art pieces are mostly about eventful events from the Bible.

                <p class="card-text">The painting "Behind the spinning wheel" shows a man working at the spinning wheel. 
                  He sits in an old-fashioned parlor, meanwhile puffing a pipe with tobacco. According to the artist, he was inspired by the myth of Hercules, who had to endure 3 years of humble female labor in the service of the Libyan queen. Women in the past had no rights and therefore their work was usually considered humiliating for warriors and men. As it violated their absolute manhood and honor of fighting and war. The cats, meanwhile, amuse themselves of life and expose certain side of the hero, distracting him from his task or illustrating that he does not belong in this environment.
                  One of the few German painters who became famous. Especially in Düsseldorf, Berlin and Hamburg he got great reputation.

                <p class="card-text">In the painting you can see a middle-class woman writing a love letter to her lover. 
                  Next to her is her servant, which at that time was quite normal for somewhat wealthy families. The servant illustrates, so to speak, the interface between the couple, because in the past the mail was usually transmitted from servant of the sender to the other servant of the recipient. The position of the servant illustrates the impatience, because the folded arms and the look out of the window makes clear that she has been waiting longer until the letter is ready and it is tugging at her patience. This painting also shows the nourishing bond between the two people, as the "lady" gives away her trust that she will deliver her letter safely and reliably. 
                  The painting "lady writing" was stolen 2 times (1974, 1986) and successfully found and returned to the custody of the state. Today the original is in the "National Gallery" in Dublin.
                  Johannes Vermeer one of the best painters of the time "Dutch Golden Age". He got great fame in Denmark, although it was disputed whether really all his paintings can really be attributed to him.
